📱 **Imject** brings its powerful image layout and PDF export functionality to Android. Upload images, arrange them into layouts, and export them — all from your phone.

> ⚠️ This is a **prototype version** of the Android build. Expect limited features and potential bugs.

### 📸 What It Does

- Upload images directly from your device  
- Arrange them on a canvas (a4 page) using customizable layouts  
- Save your layout progress using `.appimj` files  
- Export the final arrangement to a clean **PDF file**  
- Store and load projects from your device
